npm-check-updates
=================

npm-check-updates is a command-line tool that allows you to **find the latest versions of dependencies**, regardless of any version
constraints in your package.json file (unlike npm itself).

npm-check-updates can optionally upgrade your package.json file to
use the latest available versions, all while **maintaining your
existing semantic versioning policies**.

Put plainly, it will upgrade your "express": "^4.11.2" dependency to
"express": "^5.0.0" when express 5.0.0 hits the scene.

Installation
--------------

```sh
npm install -g npm-check-updates
```

Please consider installing the unstable version to help test pre-release features. You may even find [some features](#history) you needed that are not yet in the stable version. 

```sh
npm install -g npm-check-updates@unstable
```

Usage
--------------

Show any new dependencies for the project in the current directory:
```sh
$ npm-check-updates

"connect" can be updated from ^2.8.0 to ^2.11.0  (Installed: 2.8.8, Latest: 2.11.0)
"commander" can be updated from ^1.3.0 to ^2.0.0 (Installed: 1.3.2, Latest: 2.0.0)

Run with '-u' to upgrade your package.json
```

Upgrade a project's package.json:
```sh
$ npm-check-updates -u

"request" can be updated from ^2.20.0 to ^2.27.0 (Installed: 2.20.0, Latest: 2.27.1)

package.json upgraded
```

Filter by package name:
```sh
# match mocha and should packages exactly
$ npm-check-updates -f mocha,should         

# match packages that start with "gulp-" using regex
$ npm-check-updates -f /^gulp-/             

# match packages that do not start with "gulp-". Note: single quotes are required 
# here to avoid inadvertant bash parsing
$ npm-check-updates -f '/^(?!gulp-).*$/'    
```

Options
--------------
    -d, --dev                check only devDependencies
    -h, --help               output usage information
    -f, --filter <packages>  list or regex of package names to search (all others
                             will be ignored). Note: single quotes may be required 
                             to avoid inadvertant bash parsing.
    -e, --error-level        set the error-level. 1: exits with error code 0 if no  
                             errors occur. 2: exits with error code 0 if no 
                             packages need updating (useful for continuous 
                             integration) (alpha release only)
    -g, --global             check global packages instead of in the current project
    -p, --prod               check only dependencies (not devDependencies)
    -s, --silent             don't output anything
    -t, --greatest           find the highest versions available instead of the 
                             latest stable versions (alpha release only)
    -u, --upgrade            upgrade package.json dependencies to match latest 
                             versions (maintaining existing policy)
    -V, --version            output the version number


Motivation
--------------

[Package.json best practices](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/package-dependencies-done-right) recommends maintaining dependencies using a [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) policy. In practice you do this by specifying a "^1.2.0" style dependency in your package.json, whereby patch- and minor-level updates are automatically allowed but major releases require manual verification.

Unfortunately, it then becomes your responsibility to find out about new
package releases, for example by using "npm info" command one package at a time, or by visiting project pages.

How dependency updates are determined
--------------

- Direct dependencies will be increased to the latest stable version:
  - 2.0.1 => 2.2.0
  - 1.2 => 1.3
-  Semantic versioning policies for levels are maintained while satisfying the latest version:
  - ^1.2.0 => ^1.3.0
  - 1.x => 2.x
- "Any version" is maintained:
  - \* => \*
- Version constraints are maintained:
  - \>0.2.0 => \> 0.3.0
  - \>=1.0.0 => >=1.1.0
