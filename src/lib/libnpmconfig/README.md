### API

##### <a name="read"></a> `> read(cliOpts, builtinOpts)`

Reads configurations from the filesystem and the env and returns a
[`figgy-pudding`](https://npm.im/figgy-pudding) object with the configuration
values.

If `cliOpts` is provided, it will be merged with the returned config pudding,
shadowing any read values. These are intended as CLI-provided options. Do your
own `process.argv` parsing, though.

If `builtinOpts.cwd` is provided, it will be used instead of `process.cwd()` as
the starting point for config searching.
